- During greed, profit is very low while during fear, the chances of profit are comparatively high. this shows that trader remains causious during fear and make controlled profits.
- Loss occurs when there is fear in the market and sell off is very high.During fear mass selling take place and due to this number of trades become very high in comparision of the trade during the sentiment of greed and neutral.
- The highest money is infused in the market when market sentiments are neutral while, its infused is very low when sentiments are fearful. Thus people are the highest bullish when market is neutral but, their bullishness falls as market sentiment changes towards extreme greed. It indicates that people know while investing during greedy period that market is going to reset soon.

## Recommandations
- We should try to invest when market sentiment is fearful because after sometime market will have completed correction and restart gaining again which will provide us the great profit.
- One should avoid sell off during fearfull sentiment of the market as sentiment occurs due to mass sell off by new comers and, ultimately market will regain and our money will be safe again. Thus we should try to invest money for longer period not for the small period.
